This is a 3D RPG that I have created with a friend as a personal project. Please see below for more details.

The game includes a Quest System, along with the ability to move the player by running, sprinting, jumping and rolling with relevant animations. It also includes a basic combat system involving swords.

A ship will also be added so the player can travel to a few different islands collecting gold and xp which have achievements attached to them. 

The hopes are to continue this to include a levelling up system based on how much xp earned and a shop system so that gold can be spent on weapons, such as a better sword or a bow with arrows or consumables such as health potions.

All assets used come from the asset store.
