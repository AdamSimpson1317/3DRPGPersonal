This is a 3D RPG that I have created with a friend as a personal project. Please see below for more details.

Build V1.3 (Tutorial see below for more details): 

Code: 


## Summary of the Game

The game includes a Quest System, along with the ability to move the player by running, sprinting and jumping with relevant animations. It also includes a basic combat system involving swords.

A ship has been added so the player can travel to a few different islands collecting gold and xp which have achievements attached to them. 

The hopes are to continue this to include a levelling up system based on how much xp earned and a shop system so that gold can be spent on weapons, such as a better sword or a bow with arrows or consumables such as health potions.

## Tutorial Information

The current build is a tutorial version. This is so someone could quickly play the game and get a sense of how it would play if it were to be a full game. There are 2 quest givers standing next to their relevant quest items. The quest giver next to the pen shows that enemies can be killed as an objective for gold and xp. The quest giver next to the "bottles of rum" shows how instead of kills, the objective can be a collectible. There is also a shopkeeper, where you can buy food items and weapons. These currently do nothing but would be planned to increase health (by eating food or drinking a drink) or upgrading weapons so they attacked faster or did more damage.
Currently the enemies do not respwan however, this would be changed for a full version and the starting island would actually become an enemy base which a player could complete to earn extra gold and xp through finding a chest instead of completing quests.
